### Interesting Notes, and general thoughts

After doing some quick research, case statements are typically more efficient than else if statements when handling several scenarios, but the efficiency isnt apaprent until you have several scenarios (more than 3 or 4 ish). However, when comparing the run times listed after running the first comparison script, the if else statement is acctually faster.  But when running the 2nd comparison script which doesnt log each number to the console but assigns it to a variable instead, the opposite is true- the switch statement is faster.
